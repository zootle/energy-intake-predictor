# Predicting Energy Intake from Recipe Ingredients

## Project Overview

This project aims to investigate the feasibility of machine learning in 
effectively predicting the energy, or calorie content, of ingredients used in recipes. Every year 
millions of people are affected by health conditions related to diet and nutrition. Research show that it is often a struggle to 
access the right information to make informed decisions about their food choices. There are many 
industries who are reliant on providing accurate nutritional information to consumers, yet this 
is not always available due to the complexity of food composition and preparation.

Overall, a 78% accuracy has been achieved on predicting the calorie content, Energy (kJ) / per 
100g, of food ingredient on a broad set of 2893 food ingredients. This is a significant step forward in 
achieving wider goals of predicting a broader spectrum of nutritional attributes.

The project consists of a Jupyter notebook, model card and datasheet. The original dataset is 
provided alongside the permutations used for the project.

## Rationale

The use of machine learning for the application of nutritional prediction in both personal and 
commercial settings can have far-reaching benefits:

- **Dietary Management and Nutrition**: For individuals tracking their caloric intake for 
   weight management or health conditions such as diabetes, accurate information on calorie 
   content can help in making informed dietary choices. This can assist in maintaining or 
   achieving a balanced diet.

- **Labelling and Packaging**: Accurate calorie predictions can aid food manufacturers in 
   providing precise nutritional information on packaging, which is crucial for consumer 
   transparency and regulatory compliance.

- **Food Service Application**: Chefs and food service professionals can use calorie content 
   predictions to design meals that meet specific nutritional criteria, which is especially 
   useful in settings like hospitals, schools, and health-focused restaurants and supermarkets.

- **Food Technology**: Integrating calorie prediction algorithms into apps and devices can 
   enhance the functionality of kitchen gadgets and fitness trackers, making them more useful 
   for consumers aiming to monitor their overall fitness and health.

- **Research and Development**: For researchers focusing on food science and human nutrition, 
   understanding the caloric content can help in studying the impacts of various foods on human 
   health and in developing new food products that fit into healthier lifestyle choices.

- **Personalized Nutrition**: With advances in personalized medicine, predicting calorie 
   content can be part of broader efforts to tailor diets to individual genetic profiles, 
   lifestyle factors, and health goals.

- **Reducing Food Waste**: Knowing the caloric value of ingredients can also aid in better 
   managing food resources, planning meals more efficiently, and reducing waste by utilising 
   ingredients appropriately according to dietary needs.

Overall, the ability to predict calorie content accurately can contribute significantly to 
health and wellness, culinary practices, consumer technology, and broader scientific research.

Assistive technology such as this can be used to improve the health conditions of many around 
the world and this project simply scratches the surface of the potential use of machine 
learning in the field of nutrition.

## Research

The research undertaken to form the basis of this project is wholly inspirational. Since the 1940's 
nutritional data has been collected on food ingredients and their composition by the science 
community, resulting in a highly detailed dataset which only this project hardly scratches the 
surface of. This has been compiled and maintained by government bodies many years now. Please 
review the [datasheet](data_sheet.md) for more detailed information.

## Data Sources and Content

The dataset used for this analysis is the 'McCance and Widdowsonâ€™s The Composition of Foods 
Integrated Dataset 2021' and is provided by Public Health England. It contains detailed 
nutritional information for 2889 ingredients across 14 product categories. The dataset includes categorical 
data and scientific nutrient composition for each ingredient, making it highly suitable for 
practical application including machine learning models to predict nutritional value.

The data is sourced from [Public Health England](https://www.gov.
uk/government/publications/composition-of-foods-integrated-dataset-cofid), featuring ingredients 
that have undergone significant testing due to changes in food composition driven by new farming 
and manufacturing practices, public health initiatives, and variations in preparation and cooking methods.

Please see this [datasheet](data_sheet.md) for more detailed information on the dataset and the 
elements used within this project.

## Methodology

The project is broken down into the following steps:

1. Obtaining the data set for the analysis 
2. Exploration, cleaning and pre-process the data 
3. Dimension reduction and feature engineering 
4. Determine the machine learning task 
5. Partition the data 
6. Choosing the machine learning techniques 
7. Training the models and using on a test dataset 
8. Interpreting the results 
9. Deploying in a sample technique

During the data pre-processing phase, I have vectorized words associated with food names and groups 
to make them more generalizable to a broader spectrum of targets. The aim of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of adapting to a wide range of recipes and ingredients, thereby reducing its specificity to unseen data. The implementation details are shown below.

## Model evaluation

Many supervised machine learning models have been considered for this project, including:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Regression using LightGBM
- Partical Least Squares Regression with ReLU Activation
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost for Regression
- Support Vector Regression with and without PCA
- K-Nearest Neighbours Regressor


During the experimentation, I discovered that employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) actually reduced accuracy due to the high specificity required by the data. Using Linear Regression alone yielded poor results. Surprisingly, even Support Vector Regression, typically lauded for its effectiveness in high-dimensional regression tasks, also underperformed. This led me to focus on six other models for more in-depth analysis.

## Hyperparameter Optimisation

The models were extensively hyperparameter tuned using Optuna to ensure the best possible 
parameter selection for choosing a suitable model.

## Model results

The following models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Variance:

|                       |   Train_Accuracy |   Train_RMSE |    MSE |    RMSE |       R2 |   Variance |
|:----------------------|-----------------:|-------------:|-------:|--------:|---------:|-----------:|
| Ridge                 |         0.876325 |     221.559  | 131400 | 362.491 | 0.712666 |   0.714562 |
| LGBMRegressor         |         0.611449 |     392.71   | 178633 | 422.65  | 0.60938  |   0.610797 |
| PLSRegressionReLU     |         0.852259 |     242.157  | 131028 | 361.977 | 0.71348  |   0.716765 |
| RandomForestRegressor |         0.964799 |     118.202  | 114840 | 338.88  | 0.748878 |   0.748959 |
| XGBRegressor          |         0.995883 |      40.4259 | 100474 | 316.977 | 0.780291 |   0.780765 |
| KNeighborsRegressor   |         0.996474 |      37.4095 | 136899 | 369.999 | 0.70064  |   0.701494 |

The following graph shows the accuracy of the models:

Overall, there is a good level of accuracy over most of the models. The XGBoost for Regression model has stood out due to its high accuracy and low RMSE. If this overfits on further unseen data then the Random Forest Regressor would be the next best model to use.

### Conclusion

This research project utilises advanced machine learning techniques to forecast the calorie content of various food ingredients, which is pivotal for nutrition management and public health. 

Future work could explore combining models and/or feature engineering to further enhance 
prediction and scaling to a wider range of ingredients across a larger demographic. There is further scope to explore the data further, improve word classification and
